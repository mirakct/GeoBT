#2. Hydrophobicity: 2 options (which lead to different graphs) -> a) calculates the hydrophobicity directly for each residue using the predefined KD scale and plots the values against the residue numbers. b) calculates hydrophobicity scores using a sliding window approach with the KD scale, resulting in a smoothed representation of hydrophobicity scores across the sequence
##a) from the internet https://www.biob.in/2014/05/hydrophobicity-plot-using-biopython.html#:~:text=Hydrophobicity%20is%20the%20property%20of,exposed%20loops%20or%20buried%20residues.)

#3. GRAVY (using ChatGPT): GRAVY is the grand average of hydropathy. It is calculated by summing the hydropathy values of all the amino acids in the sequence and dividing by the number of residues in the sequence.
# GRAVY = (Î£hydropathy values of all the amino acids in the sequence) / (number of residues in the sequence)
# GRAVY values range from -4.5 to +4.5. The more positive the GRAVY value, the more hydrophobic the protein is. The more negative the GRAVY value, the more hydrophilic the protein is.
# GRAVY values can be used to compare the hydrophobicity of different proteins. The protein with the higher GRAVY value is more hydrophobic than the protein with the lower GRAVY value.
